# zema-learn
ZemaLearn is a web-based application designed to help users learn Amharic through music by transforming Amharic songs into structured, educational lyric experiences. The platform will accept an uploaded Amharic song (or audio link), isolate vocals using source-separation models, and transcribe the lyrics using advanced speech recognition models such as Whisper. The raw transcription will then be refined using large language models to correct spelling, restore poetic structure, and preserve cultural nuance. The system will generate high-quality English translations that prioritize emotional and metaphorical meaning rather than literal word substitution. Future iterations may include line-by-line synchronization with audio, transliteration for learners unfamiliar with the Ge’ez script, word-level vocabulary explanations, cultural annotations for idiomatic expressions, and a community-based correction system to improve accuracy over time. By combining speech recognition, natural language processing, and modern web technologies, ZemaLearn aims to serve as both a language-learning tool and a cultural bridge for the global Ethiopian diaspora.
